    <h1> No , this is not about toys ! It's about our great friend, the mighty WURFL! Let us tell you what is can do ! </h1>
    <h3>For those who don't know what it is , we are here to make you smarter every day !</h3> 
    <H4>Let us put it this way : 
    If facebook knows everyone , WURFL knows every electronic device !</H4>
    <p>Thanks to the work of many people ARROUND THE WORLD , 1 single file (XML) known as the Wireless Universal Resource File contains a massive amount of information about every mobile device ever built , literally !   </p>
    <p> Now let's dive in deeper together and see what capabilities does it offer . Capabilities can be either Static or Virtual.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>brand_name | A static capability that allow us to retreive a device brand name or complete_device_name Ex:Samsung\LG...</p>
    <p> is_connected_tv | A static capability of a boolean Type (can be either true or false)  that returns true if the device in question that is a Television AND can be connected to the internet.  </p>
    <p>is_ios | A Virtual capability that returns true (You guessed it , it a boolean type) if the device runs on any IOS version. </p>
    <p> mp3 | A static capability and as it implies , this capability returns true if the device supports MP3 sound format. </p>
